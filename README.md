# 🎓 Student Performance Predictor

A Machine Learning web application that predicts a student’s exam score based on academic and lifestyle factors such as study hours, attendance, mental health, sleep hours, and part-time job status.

The project demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data analysis to model deployment using Streamlit.
